Coding in GJS is very painfull

functions are missing, like newlocale/uselocale, when I trying to add them by gir/typelib, pointer passing are broken, when trying guint64 to replace gpointer, overflow happened.
Bugs of the problems I faced have already been reported years ago, but leaving unfixed, with a similiar comment:

`This API is not introspectable. This works in PyGObject because they implemented a wrapper around the C API and use it in their imports system.`
